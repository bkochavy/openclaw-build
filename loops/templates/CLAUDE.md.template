# Project Conventions

## Stack
- Framework: [e.g. Next.js 15, SwiftUI, Express]
- Language: [e.g. TypeScript, Swift, Python]
- Key libraries: [e.g. Tailwind, Zustand, Prisma]

## Patterns
- State management: [e.g. Zustand stores in /stores]
- Routing: [e.g. App Router, file-based]
- API style: [e.g. REST with /api prefix, tRPC]
- Component structure: [e.g. /components/ui for primitives, /components/features for composed]

## Testing
- Framework: [e.g. Vitest, Jest, XCTest]
- Run: [e.g. `npm test`, `swift test`]
- Coverage: [e.g. all logic functions must have tests]

## Gotchas
- [Add discovered gotchas here as you find them]

## Design Direction (if UI project)
- [e.g. Dark mode, minimal, inspired by Linear/Raycast]
- [Anti-patterns: NO generic AI look, NO default Tailwind colors]
