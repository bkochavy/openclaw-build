# [Feature Name] — PRD

## Overview
[What this feature/project does in 2-3 sentences]

## Verification Commands
Run these after EVERY task. A task is NOT done until all pass.
- Typecheck: `[e.g. npx tsc --noEmit]`
- Tests: `[e.g. npm test]`
- Lint: `[e.g. npx eslint .]`
- Build: `[e.g. npm run build]`

> These should match `.ralphy/config.yaml` commands. Ralphy runs test/lint
> automatically between tasks, but include them here so the agent runs them
> within its own context too.

## Tasks
- [ ] [Task 1: description — independently verifiable]
- [ ] [Task 2: description]
- [ ] [Task 3: description]
- [ ] [Task N: ...]

<!-- If this project starts a dev server, add this as Task 1:
- [ ] Kill any existing process on port XXXX: `lsof -ti:XXXX | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true`
-->

## Notes
- Each task = one commit with a descriptive message
- Run verification commands before marking any task complete
- If verification fails, fix the issue before moving on
- Ralphy manages inter-task memory automatically via `.ralphy/progress.txt` and rules in `.ralphy/config.yaml` — no need to repeat memory instructions in the PRD
